#### Epicodus Intro to Programming: Weekly Independent Project
Friday June 8th, 2018

#### By Matt Smith

## Description
construct a site that counts down to zero from an inputted number and makes 3 seperate changes in this order of importance:
* replaces numbers containing the integer "0" with a "BEEP"
* replaces numbers containing the integer "1" with a "BOOP"
* replaces number divisible by 3 with a quote from 2001

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Replace numbers that contain a "0" with "BEEP"** | 10 | BEEP |
| **Replace Numbers that contain a "1" with "BOOP"** | 11 | BOOP |
| **Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with a phrase**| 9 | I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.|
| **Other numbers activate a countdown**| 4 | 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 |


### Known Bugs
