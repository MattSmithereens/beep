* replaces number divisible by 3 with a quote from 2001
* replaces numbers containing the integer "1" with a "BOOP"
* replaces numbers containing the integer "0" with a "BEEP"

construct a site that counts down to zero from an inputted number less than 30 unless one of these conditions is met:
* replaces numbers containing the integer "0" with a "BEEP"
* replaces numbers containing the integer "1" with a "BOOP"
* replaces number divisible by 3 (including zero, since it technically doesn't divide with a remainder) with a quote from 2001
>>>>>>> gh-pages
* numbers larger than 30 will display an error message since such outputted countdowns can become unwieldy very quickly
