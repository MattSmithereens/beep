## Description
construct a site that counts down to zero from an inputted number less than 30 unless one of these conditions is met:
* replaces numbers containing the integer "0" with a "BEEP"
* replaces numbers containing the integer "1" with a "BOOP"
* replaces number divisible by 3 (including zero, since it technically doesn't divide with a remainder) with a quote from 2001
* numbers larger than 30 will display an error message since such outputted countdowns can become unwieldy very quickly

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Replace numbers that contain a "0" with "BEEP"** | 20 | BEEP...19 [...] |
| **Replace Numbers that contain a "1" with "BOOP"** | 11 | BOOP...BEEP[...] |
| **Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with a phrase**| 9 | I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that...8[...]|
| **Numbers larger than 30 are replaced with a phrase and do not count down**| 10e4 | You're being unreasonable, Dave.  That number is too large|
